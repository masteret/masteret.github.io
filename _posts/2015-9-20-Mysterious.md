Just half month after school started, I have already started to study late at night. It is clearly not a good thing to do because I am losing quiz points in class. At first I thought since I audited the course last semester, the quizzes shouldn't be hard, but I was wrong, definitely wrong.

It takes time to understand the content of lecture. You won't be able to remember the details if you only pay attention in class. You need to review the material, practice it on your local machine. One thing I like to do is to download the .py files, run it first, and then start to play around it. That way you can learn the difference between each functions/algorithms.

But apparently I don't have time to do this, my balance is broken. Career events are overwhelming me and I sometimes feel like I only have time to study for 1 our of my 4 classes. I haven't missed any reading from this class, but I already missed 1 week of readings for other classes...I still remember the college advice [article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html), saying that I shouldn't blow off non-CS classes. I tried, failed, but I will keep trying.

**Tips of the week:**
Try out pair programming, one thing that recruiters care is your experience in good programming scheme. If you can tell a story about how you do pair programming with your partner, that would be an impressive point. Also, try to learn agile development if possible, lots and lots of companies use agile development. It doesn't take you hours to learn, but it can play a critical role for you to get an interview chance.
