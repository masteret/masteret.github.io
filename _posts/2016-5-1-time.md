1. What did I do this past week?  
Another regular routine of going to class. I stayed up all night on Thursday night and got called to answer the first question in Friday morning class. My brain was literally blank after I heard my name, but weirdly knowledge started merging after a few seconds and I was able to answer the questions. Maybe I spent enough time studying the concept for this class.    

2. What's in my way?  
The long-time haunting test is finally coming this week. I haven't started study yet because I slept through half my weekend and relaxed the other half. (4+0 hours sleeping on Wednesday and Thursday night) But I will definitely start this week.      

3. What will I do next week?  
Shape, AbstractShape, Circle, Handle...they are currently flying aimlessly in my head, but I am definitely going to put them in order. Other than that, I still got one group project due and one test (Cumulative!). This is going to be a busy week, but come on, who isn't busy during final week?   

4. Experience in class  
We continued to cover handle class last week. I learned a lot from it but I still cannot see how will I use it in real life. I know it is hard to have something like codingBat to work for a class like this, but if there is any, that would be much helpful, so handy, wow (doge face)  

I should go study...

Tip of the week:  
[Software Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258), [Another one](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_testing/index.htm). One of my regret in UTCS is that I never learned how to debug and test properly. But that is definitely a big part in a software development role. Several of my code were reviewed by my colleagues and one question always popped up "Didn't you test this?" My answer was always "I tested the code, but I didn't cover this part." The scope of a school project maybe small enough to cover by several hours of testing, but once you start to work on a big project, it is really important to test your code thoroughly, ensure backward comparability (new function shouldn't break old function) and make sure your colleagues know how to run your test and replicate your result.
