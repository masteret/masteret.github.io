title: Refactor the factor
---
It is about 1 month left in CS373. We starts to cover the process of refactoring Java code. It brings back the old memory when I first start to code. I wrote lines of code in one function and at that time I thought "How can someone separate these? All these code must live together!" But after years of practice, I understand the importance of separating functionalities and writing code with clear logic.

I have started to review others code after I started my job in my current company. It is not easy to understand what other programmers were thinking when they wrote the code. Some separate functions too much and create functions with similar purpose. Some create a single powerful functions but burden too many logic in it to make it hard to read. It is hard to find a balance between complex function and duplicate function.

Refactoring code can help to solve the problem. We do need to separate some functions, I find the rule "If you have an 'and' in your function name, you need to separate the function" very useful. Also you need to know what functions that others have already implemented and how can you use them, so you won't create some duplicate functions. Other than that, you need to be crystal clear about your logic. It is dangerous to write something that you don't know how it works. I learned it in a hard way in project IDB2.

Python can be dangerous, even though it is not a Python in the picture

**Tip of the week:**
I have a chance to talk to a developer in Rackspace this week. She gave me a piece of advice that I think is very useful. You need to keep 100% focus during work, but after you go home, don't do anything work related. You can read articles that is related to the technology you are using, but you shouldn't work at home. That way you won't burn yourself out, and you are still keeping up with the latest trend in the industry.
