1. What did I do this past week?  
This is another quiet week, since we don't have project due next week, I got the chance to recharge myself and clean up everything that stacked up before. In fact, I did a great job cleaning up tasks in my task list and pave myself a great path for next week challenge.  

2. What's in my way?  
Speaking of next week challenge, the test for CS371p is coming up and I have to admit that I am super nervous about that. It seems that my study method isn't compatible with this kind of the test. I tend to grab tools and build things, but my experience is that the test will be more about building the tool itself. I can do great on the projects but my performance on test isn't as good as that.  

3. What will I do next week?  
I am going to try a new method to study for the test. Since code isn't allow on cheat sheet (oh no, those are the things that I rely on), I will need to memorize the implementation in C++ language. It is going to be challenging because I tend to memorize thing with Python in my mind. But I will try my best studying for code in C++ version.   

4. Experience in class  
It is amusing to learn that the quiz this week is a bit easier than the previous week. I also got the grade from project 2, which shows a good result and I am glad that the effort of my partner and I has paid off. Personally I am not that great at absorbing code example in class, but I cannot think of a better way of learning them except for practicing over and over again.

Let's take a 5 minutes break for every 10 minutes.

Tip of the week:  
[Kodi](http://kodi.wiki/view/Development) is an open source, multi-platform software media center. I use Kodi everyday with my Raspberry Pi, it is a good operating system and the functionality is satisfying. Most importantly, it is open source! I think it will be nice if we can contribute to this open source project (and perhaps put it on our resume) Most add-on are in Python and the core is written in C++.
