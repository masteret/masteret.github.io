title: Tweet City!
---
We finish project IDB! Whoooooaaaaaah! It's the last part of our 3-phases project and I am glad that my teammates and I finally put together this website.It's never easy to do anything in this project. From building a working website to scraping data from online source. Every steps are like baby steps to us, but we learned to crawl, learned to walk, and now we sprint!  
The last part of the project is mainly about refining our website and exercising api from another group, which is an anime database. Since we are the Tweet City, we have all kinds of tweet including anime tweets. We implement a search function that search for anime information and related tweets, put together in a page of our website. It feels so good when the other group saw my work and said "wow that's so cool!" Sometimes it feels good not only when your work get credit (points), but also when someone admires your work. Best feeling in the world!  
Last part of our lectures cover different methods and extends in Java, I am a little bit confused by that because after seeing all the Python code, I have forgotten some Java code. But understanding the concept about whether this method will get overwritten or not will help me dramatically in the future. First, I won't write confusing code that doesn't work the way I want (you think it is overwritten? no it's not!) Second, if someone write confusing code, I can help them to debug! Isn't it great to help people?..

**Tip of the week:**
Don't even try to edit anything on a running server, especially in the master branch! You test everything locally, push it to server, use git to switch to a testing branch temporarily and see if everything work on server. Directly editing master branch on server may cause miserable result and get you frustrated. Please take the advice from former apocalypse survivor.
