1. What did I do this past week?  
We spent a lot of time working on project Darwin, thanks to good planning and starting early, we finished all the work one day before due. It also gave me extra time to study the tests on those 2 days. The algorithm behind Darwin isn't hard, but rather complicated. We have to modify our code several times before we can match the correct results. Another interesting thing is that, since there are too many variations of steps, we sometimes end up in segmentation fault and to be honest, the error message is basically useless.    

2. What's in my way?  
There are 1 more project and 1 more test in this class before my graduation (hopefully), I am more concerned about the test because all the tests I took before with Downing didn't get a good result, the reason is mainly lack of practice. Just reading code helps a little when you need to actually implement the solution.   

3. What will I do next week?  
I finished my tests this week, that means next week will be pretty free, so it is definitely --- Project time! Hopefully the next project won't be as hard as Darwin, so I can break my record of finishing project 2 days earlier to a higher number.   

4. Experience in class  
The lectures start to cover new content that reuse old code from previous classes, which is beneficial to me given that I never truly understand what the old code is doing. I can relearn them by examples study them with exam 2. Also it is weird that the first few cold calls in class never get responds, since it already passed the Q-drop period, I wonder people just don't care about attendance anymore?  

Darwin?

Tip of the week:  
[Dude what? 3D teleport?](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/microsoft-holoportation-star-wars-hologram/), With AlphaGo changing how people look at AI, Virtual Reality is also starting to change how people see computer generated graphics. Now it can integrate real world information into the virtual world. Imagine a Skype call with your parents who seems to be sitting on your couch (and they may be able to see how messy your living room is), this requires more advance graphic processing program and we will be the one to implement it.
