It's probably my last blog entry in CS373 class, we all survived this class. This is one of the best learning experience I ever had. The right combination of project, quizzes and tests cover everything I need to know and go beyond to fulfill my knowledge.

For projects, it is a lot of teamwork and I think that good partner is more important than partner with experience. You will get good grade by someone carrying the whole team, but you only learn when you all stuck in the lab and finally get the code to work. It's about the amount of time and brain cells you contribute into here to decide how much you learn. Also make sure you try out different tools and have good documentation about what have you done, the project is definitely a shiny bullet point in your resume.

Quizzes are great, don't be afraid, just stay 100% focus in class. You'll understand the material easily and with no problem. The most difficult part is to stay focus during the later half of the semester, when you are tired and buried by homework. Definitely drink coffee first, or juice.

This is yet another class that project doesn't have anything to do with the test, make sure to stay humble when you score perfectly on project. If you don't study the test as hard as you do your project, you will definitely regret that! (Learned it in a hard way)

Overall, this is the course where your contribution reflect equally with the result. Definitely a place to get pseudo-real world software engineering experience. One of the best CS course to take before you graduate!
