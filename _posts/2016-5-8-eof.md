1. What did I do this past week?  
I survived the last class week...If everything turns out alright, this will be my last class week of college. Compared to my friends, I found my last class week much more intensive. Some of their classes end on Wednesday/Thursday, but I had 2 tests on Thursday and Friday back to back. Test 2 of OOP didn't go very well for me, I spent 25 minutes on reading all questions + answered question 1 on a 50 minutes test. I was kind of shocked when I saw the timer said 25 minutes left after I finished the first one. Gladly I had time to finish most of the remaining part.    

2. What's in my way?  
I STILL HAVE FINAL...IN FINAL WEEK...As a graduating senior I have a mixed feeling about this extra final, on one hand I got to stay in school a little longer, on the other hand I have to study for the final instead of doing whatever I want.   
Besides school, since the day of my full time job is coming closer, I start to feel a little panic about the unforeseen future and don't know what to do about it. Hopefully I can survive in the real world.  

3. What will I do next week?  
First of all, I need to study for my final, which is extremely important and somewhat meaningful to me (took the course purely for interest). I also need to wrap up my work for my part-time job, which I will return as full time after a month. Apparently final week blow some of the work off and I need to focus on finishing them before next Friday. Otherwise the issues will be hanging there for a month...     

4. Experience in class  
OOP and SWE are courses that I learned tons of knowledge from, the interesting cold call quiz in class always trigger my brain and sometimes I will still have that little panic moment when I heard my name. But it is super useful because I memorize the answer better than just reading the book. Project also help me a lot by sharpening my skill and learn a better coding style.  

Last blog must be finished with my favorite pic!

Tip of the week:  
[Have to do this one](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/). If there is one thing that helps me the most with my software development skill, it must be UTCS. Honestly, there is no other websites/tutorial that can teach me that much like UTCS did. This is one of the best experience in my life and I am honor to be one of the student in UTCS and in Downing's classes.
