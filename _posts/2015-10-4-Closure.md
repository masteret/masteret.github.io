title: Closure
---
It's all about closure...This week in CS373. For the first time I am completely confused about the lecture. The idea of closure is fascinating but also hard to understand, at least for me. I have a feeling that this can be done in a more naive way, sacrificing security, space and time, we can throw closure away. But what make us, UTCS students, different from other is that, we have the best resource, we learn from the best and get the best out of it. For all the "weird" things I learned, like reduce, map and now closure, I progressively become a better programmer.

But apparently it's not enough. From the reading this week, [The Single Responsibility Principle](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf) and [Database design with UML and SQL](http://www.tomjewett.com/dbdesign/dbdesign.php), I learn about good programming design scheme and a field that I wasn't interested in before, database. I was a programmer with terrible coding style, it was common for me to write a function with more than 100 lines before. Then I know about separating functions, but I still had no idea why. Now I understand the concept, because we need to keep a balance between extension and modification. How to improve our code without breaking it? That makes programmer better than code monkey.

Some of the recruiters in the Career Fair asked me about experience with database, which surprised me because I didn't know database is so important in today's company, but apparently most of the company have some kind of database and it is their backbone/resource pool to serve customer. I hope now isn't too late to learn about database and I am glad that I am in this class, so I can know about what knowledge do I lacked.

**Tip of the week:**
If you feel like you are great at programming, try and go to an ACM contest. The ACM ICPC qualification contest last Friday makes me feel like I am an idiot. But I now know how tiny I am and beginning to work harder. Solving complex problem can sharpen your skill and make your resume look good. Also the feeling after solving a hard problem is very rewarding.
