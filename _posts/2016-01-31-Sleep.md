title: Sleep...

1. What did I do this past week?  
I still haven't figured out how do I survive this past week. With an average of 4 hours of sleep per day, I can't really get anything done. I barely finished quizzes and assignments from other classes. I guess I spent too much time trying to figure out how to get my android device work. It's really really important to not buy anything that include any program from some cheap brand. I spent at least 12 hours on the device and it pushes back everything on my schedule. Including the study/project plan for this class.  

2. What's in my way?  
Gladly, I get the device to work, so right now I only need to wait for my book and do the project. An interesting thing is that this book seems hard to find an online version. I tried many sources and still not able to find a pdf/ebook version of it. Personally I am not a fan of buying textbook and I haven't bought anything in almost two years. I have to do it this time in my last semester...and the book hasn't arrived yet!

3. What will I do next week?  
It seems that a lot of students is having trouble with the project. I hope it will just be as hard as last time, so my estimated time won't be off. One thing I find interesting is that C++ seems to be more loose than Python, so it may requires extra work for me to do. Oh and one last thing, Career Fair is coming up! Good luck everyone!

Woohoo!

Tip of the week:  
I was talking to a recruiter in a career event last week and he told me an important advice on how to improve my resume. Since the first round of resume scanning is usually done by non-programmer, some recruiters may look for resume that fit their job description the most, so it is important to include the tools that you use in your resume, rather than just saying what have you done!
