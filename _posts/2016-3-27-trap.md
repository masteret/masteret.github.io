title: It's a trap!
---
1. What did I do this past week?  
My partner and I finished project 3 one day before it is due, we are smart enough to work on Spring break and finished the implementation on Monday, then we spent 2 more days to test our project. It turns out that my lack of attention in class is actually jeopardizing my score because 1) I misinterpret how to implement parts of the project 2) My mistakes in the test are mostly syntax error, the implementation is fine. If I want to fix this, I definitely need to pay more attention i class.    

2. What's in my way?  
It is another relatively free period in this semester, which doesn't feel good at all because past experience told me that I always feel stressful and regretful after these periods, so I need to tackle this period differently. Instead of hanging around doing nothing, I must fight my laziness and procrastination.   

3. What will I do next week?  
Since I have nothing important due next week, I won't do...juuuuust kidding. Project 4 is definitely coming up and I have heard that it is way harder than project 3. I'd need to review material and practice problems (const and template) to make sure I won't miss them next time. I can't let my partner save me every time.   

4. Experience in class  
It is weird that more and more students don't show up in class (no response to cold-call). I always think that this isn't a class that you can skip 1/2 lectures and still pick up material in the following lectures. Every lectures has a different topic and it is much more efficient to learn in class than learning it by yourself.  

Nothing to do this week?

Tip of the week:  
[Problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/252703/python-append-vs-extend), so I went into a stupid mistake with my work this week. I accidentally extend a string in python instead of appending it, more interestingly, the original string is two backslash with one dollar sign, and after it extends, the two backslash is still in the same block! Next time when you try to extend/append something, make sure you know what's the type of your object.
