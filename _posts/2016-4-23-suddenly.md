title: Suddenly Realized
---
1. What did I do this past week?  
Project Life is finally done. The implementation of the project was done during last weekend, but it contains a lot of tweaks over the week. It is a new level of object-oriented programming experience to me. I thought oop was just about class containing method/values before, but apparently there are a lot more things that I barely know about.    

2. What's in my way?  
With the last project done, it means there is only test left for this class. I have said multiple times that I never truly understand how to study for the test, this is another chance to try again. The second half of the class covers fewer topics but they are deeply concentrated, It'll require lots of practices and cover enough variances of code to study.    

3. What will I do next week?  
With 2 tests and 1 project for another class due during last week of class. I feel the need to study earlier this week. I should probably create a lot of .cpp and .h file to rewrite the class example and try to change them to see different output. Also I should get ready for the last battle...   

4. Experience in class  
I tried to learn the material by my own before classes last week because of the project Life, it gave me a different aspect to see the lecture and I feel like during classes, I can strengthen my knowledge with examples and get something clarify. Overall, this class is being very beneficial to me given that I knew almost nothing about c++ before this class.

Tip of the week:  
[Python variable pass by?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference)  I was trying to find a bug related to multi-processing at work this week. It turns out that the object I pass to the multi-processing queue is copied multiple times during the process and the parent object (which every child process copied from) never get updated. Searching on stackoverflow leads me to this answer and after combining the knowledge with this class, I feel like "Why didn't I use c++ to write this at first place?" This is one of the few moments where I find myself missing pointer so much.
