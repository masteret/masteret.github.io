This week in CS373, we mainly focus on Regular Expressions. My first impression with Regex is that "Oh, so now we use symbol to represent symbol?" It turns out that my impression is correct...Regex is about generalizing string with .*^? etc.

Learning Regex is like learning a new language with a completely different alphabet table (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English ...) But Regex focuses more on grammar and with very few characters, which is nice because I don't need to memorize so much meanings of symbols. Although I haven't used Regex for any complicated task, but I think it can achieve some difficult goal in the data parsing field. No more substring, if find, split etc.

Besides Regex, we also starts to cover some SQL commend. To be honest, it really looks like a CLI version of Excel to me...but it has an important feature: It doesn't require a fully loading before searching for something. Imagine when you open a big file in Excel just to count how many "wow" in each cells? That's the spirit. It also make data analyzing more simple, one simple command can output the exact result you want, without any extra information. But to be fair, SQL and Excel are used by different users, so I shouldn't be too harsh on Excel.

**Tip of the week:**
For a complete starter to learn Regex, [this tutorial](http://regexone.com/) provides a really starter-friendly, interactive tutorial. Personally I started to learn Regex from this tutorial, even thought it doesn't cover all cases, it does cover enough for a starter to use. It also use a very interesting way to help users learn. 10/10 recommend!
