Project 3 is out! Repeat, project 3 is out! This week in CS373, we had the chance to decide our own topic for the project. I am glad that I didn't need to spend so much time to find a group and the group members are super nice. We brainstormed about ideas and finally came to a decision that we will do a Tweets database.

I am very confident with my team members. As Professor said, our team should have people with different talents. We have an awesome web dev, two backend dev, a wonderful QA and a python dev. We basically covered every part of the project and are doing our jobs.

My job is to play with the API and grab all the starting data. At first I thought it should be an easy job because it looks like the RESTful API only uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. But I didn't realize that the Twitter API needs authentication! Instead of grabbing data freely, I need to setup credential, send limited amount of request and wait several minutes to send the next one. The json file that I get back is another problem, I can only get 100 tweets per request, but each tweet contains about 100 different values, which make storing data a big problem.

But...as an experienced python dev, these kind of problems didn't bother me too long. If I need to wait to send request, let's wait! If there are too many data in the json file, just parse it and throw the useless things away! Nothing is going to stop me from playing with data, especially in Python!

**Tip of the week:**
Be sure to look into the job requirements before choosing courses, there are some common requirements that appear many times in SWE positions. For example, experience with RESTful API, strong C++/Java skill (either 1 or both), know OOP. Always stay one step ahead, so you can have a better chance.
