title: Take a break
---
1. What did I do this past week?  
I successfully adjusted my schedule and started to make up what's left behind. We had a UT Alumni spoke to us in Wednesday lecture. He works in Main Street Hub which helps local business handle the online business part. I am happy to know that there is other company using Atlassian products like Jira/Stash to maintain their code base. I use them in my part-time job and they are great way to keep track of big project. My teammate and I also started to work on the new project voting. We successfully drew the whole diagram in our first meeting. Everything seems to work as plan.  

2. What's in my way?  
Hohoho, the voting project uses C++, which has a compiler, which is different from Python, and the error messages is really confusing. Even though we know how should the logic be done, but handling all the #include and declaration really throws me off guard. I need to take some times to figure what is happening with our code.

3. What will I do next week?  
Apparently our project isn't finished, so I will need to keep work on that. Also since this week will be less busy (no due with an emergency...) I'd love to read through book again just to get a better idea of how to write better code. I am glad that my partner can point out my design flaw in the code but I also need to put effort to avoid writing bad code.

Break

Tip of the week:  
http://www.inquisitr.com/2778746/google-developing-virtual-reality-headset-to-rival-gear-vr-and-oculus-rift/ After trying the HTC VIVE VR gear during their on campus event. I realized that VR really needs some software support. The hardware and the experience is very great, the news are all talking about the release day of different brands VR, but there is nothing to support it! It takes a long time to transform from 2D movie to 3D movie, but I think the transformation from 3D to 360 VR should be shorter with the help of GoPro which takes 360 video and already established 3D modeling technique. As software engineer, we should also upgrade ourselves to adopt this new technique and start thinking what software should be implemented in it.
