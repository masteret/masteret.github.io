This week on CS373, featuring the marvelous project - Collatz! To be honest, solving the problem itself isn't difficult at all, but I know that professor Downing won't give us such meaningless assignment. I know that when I first look at the requirement page.

38 requirements! Not 3 nor 8, it has 38 requirements! But when I read through each of them, I realized that it is not much different to my Summer internship. I feel lucky that I have hands on experience of most of the project management requirement, such as source control, issue tracking, continuous integration etc. I always feel like this kind of requirements should be included in our first upper-division class, when things start getting serious. With this project, I am sure that I will learn a lot about how to build a good project in the future, also about how to become a good programmer.

My feeling after I finish my reading is "Why don't I read this first year!"![rage-comic](http://cdn.jaxov.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Y-U-NO-Guy-Meme-Face.jpg) 
Yes, honestly, I feel like the articles should be included alongside with CS314, which should be renamed to "How to ace technical interview - part 1" in my opinion. I have surely learned a lot after my Summer internship, but the readings help me to sort out my experience and even tell me more useful things. (Maybe I won't bother to read them before my internship, but if I can travel back in time, I would definitely tell myself 2 years ago to go read the damn articles)

**Tip of the week:**
Go read the articles, just go read them...
The real tip of the week is, when you first start developing, find yourself a comfortable, expandable and efficient working environment. The CS lab has many different desktop sessions, try and configure them to see which one works best for you. I like xfce + sublime + terminal just because I feel comfortable using them (The real reason is I can right click and open terminal in current directory), but I am sure that there would be something more powerful or more convenient  for others.
