1. What did I do this past week?  
My partner and I successfully turned in project 2 two hours before due time and walked out of the lab like a boss. It is a great experience to work with my partner because both of us are eager to learn new things and we planned thoroughly before implementing anything. We spent a day trying to work out the basic structure of our code, spent another day to write basic functions and unit tests. After that we started to build all the other things on top. Every errors we encountered can be traced and we handled them easily and shortly. It is by far the greatest pair programming experience I have ever had.  

2. What's in my way?  
My lack of experience in C++ isn't just dragging me behind in class. My last conversation with a software engineer ended up pretty badly by she honestly pointed out that my experience in Python worth nothing and suggested me to look for opportunities in business team that needs some programming skills. I am indeed very regretful for not learning C++ earlier or build up my Java skill. I really hope I still have time to make this up.  

3. What will I do next week?  
Based on my performance in Software Engineering class last semester, the written test is my weakest part in this kind of course. I am going to start study earlier and try out the example that Prof. Downing provides. It's not only about understanding how the code works like we did in class, but also be able to reproduce the code from scratch. This time I am going to try beating my personal best score in last semester.   

4.  My experience in class  
To be honest, it is very hard to fall asleep in lecture because of the random questions that may pop up. I always feel the enthusiasm to engage in class (no, not just the discussion part) and I like to take notes that will help to understand the Google Doc better. It is nice to have a Google Doc because I had a hard time last semester trying to tidy my note. But with the help of an official Google Doc, bye bye bad hand-writing!

Tip of the week:  
[Code Reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/) Since I am new to C++, I sometimes find myself have an algorithm/solution in mind but don't know the exact code to type into the file. This website helps me a lot to find information about different C++ functions and libraries. I am so relieved after I found out that vector in C++ is similar to list in Python, and this website gives me all the information I need to know about vector, which turns out to be one of the most important component in my project 2.
