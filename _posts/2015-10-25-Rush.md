Hohoho! Project 3 is due, where is your god now? Apparently this is a busy week to me, the complexity of project 3 is beyond my imagination. I am naive to think that as long as I finish my part of work then the project is good to go. It turns out that there were many unclaimed part and everyone needed to work together to get things done. We were literally still pushing updates to the Github repo in the last minute. This brought back the good old memory of my CS439 class, which is one of the most difficult, intense course. In that course my teammates and I were stuck in the lab trying to figure out what's going on. While in this course my teammates and I were stuck in different places using Slack to communicate and pushing different updates to the server.

But hey, this's a great experience to learn. Don't procrastinate! Just do it! Yesterday you said tomorrow, so just do it! Not only finish your part, contribute 10% more and help out the others. Check the requirement constantly to ensure you don't miss anything. Be a good team worker.

Besides the project, this week in class we started to cover database, which is a new topic that I never learned before. I am glad that we can have the chance to implement some database methods in class, which help us understand the method better. When you need to implement a method by yourself, you need to understand it thoroughly. You also need to take care of corner cases. Combining this with the cold call in class, I surely learned a great deal of stuff.

**Tip of the week:**
Besides RESTful API, spend sometimes try to do something with Flask. [This tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) includes many information about how to use Flask and build a big project. It seems that many people start to value Flask as an important framework and I think it is a good time to start picking up. It may help you with your career later on.
