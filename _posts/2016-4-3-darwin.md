1. What did I do this past week?  
We had 2 guest speakers from Atlassian to give us a talk this week, they introduced us with an agile development process using their company products. Even though I am quite familiar with their products, I still think it is useful to learn about how to "do agile" properly, so it won't become another waterfall development process.   

2. What's in my way?  
My partner and I spend a lot of time trying to implement the classes for project Darwin, our draft design document only helps partially and we have a lot of doubts. It is also challenging to write all the tests from scratch with all the private variables and no getters/setters.   

3. What will I do next week?  
Remember I said in the last blog entry that the last week is weirdly quiet? Here's the comeback, 1 quiz due weekend, 2 exams and 2 projects due next week. All of sudden I experienced the life of a toddler and become a 12 hours shift worker who continuously work 3 shifts in a row. Hope my time management can save me this time.    

4. Experience in class  
The difference in difficulty between project 3 and 4 is huge. It is probably because we need to explore and think more in project 4. But I think this is more like real-world problem because the customers may not have the detailed requirement all the time. Sometimes it is left to us programmers to think what is needed.

Me this week

Tip of the week:  
[Find always return true](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13183784/string-find-returns-true-always-c) Maaaaaaake sure when you use find to check substring in C++, you need to compare it with null pointer. Otherwise it will always return true value. In boolean context, 0 is false, but find returns 0 when the substring appear at index 0! Which is bad, really bad.
