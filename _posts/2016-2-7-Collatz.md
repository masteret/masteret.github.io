title: Collatz!!!

1. What did I do this past week?  
I survived the career week! Not completely, but at least I am alive! I made the same mistake as last semester, starting the project very late and leave myself without any extra time to get familiar with everything. Surprisingly without any C++ experience, my code doesn't output any weird messages. But I am very surprised that Sphere has tightened their time limit, even my old Python solution doesn't work this time (it was very good last semester). Besides the Collatz project, I also went to the UTCS Career Night and T&S Career Fair (a.k.a. CS Career Fair). The project I did in Downing's CS373 class really catch the recruiters' eyeballs. (One of the recruiter said he will check the link that is on my resume!)  

2. What's in my way?  
Readings! I stacked up so many readings and they are haunting me every minutes! I really need to catch up with the readings (Gladly, my book finally arrived!). But there is also another important thing to do. Follow up with recruiters and apply for jobs, there is no way I can escape this and hope a job opportunity fall from a tree.  

3. What will I do next week?  
I can't procrastinate anymore. Job application must fill out today and project 2 is on the way. I am totally comfortable with pair-programming and looking forward to work with some classmates. This time I cannot rely on past experience and I need to figure how to code better in C++. At last, I must face my old enemy of all time, the reading monster!

Rrrrrrrrr Sphere!

Tip of the week:  
Another piece of advice from a recruiter. Even though you have secured your internship, make sure what you do is related to what you want to do in the future, if the job that is assigned to you isn't the most interested thing you want to do. Ask for it! Go to your manager and ask for a switch/add-on project for your internship. When you are looking for a full-time job, an internship with not-related experience may not help you that much.
