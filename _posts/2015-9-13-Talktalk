title: Talk talk
---
We have a guess speaker from Bloomberg this week. He is an alumni of UTCS and also CS373 class, it is nice to hear someone as a Software Engineer shared his experience, That's why I like to go to Career Fair/other networking events to talk to technical recruiters. You can gain new knowledge from text (books/online) at all time, but you only have limited opportunity  to listen to someone share his experience.
What I like about experience is that it is exactly the things we may know about, it is something critical to the speaker and/or to others. It may be something that took someone years to figure out, but with the person shared his experience, we can prevent spending years on that. Most people only go to college once in their life, so why don't we value this experience and get the best out of it, by listening to others?
One thing I notice from recruiters/engineer I have talked to is that, they are very happy and seems to have a very good work/life balance. I thought the software development industry contains many "code monkey" burning midnight oils, but it seems not to be the case. It is true that we stretch ourselves, but we also need to relax. Pair programming helps this process by switching roles constantly, so we won't burn the same part of our brain over time.

**Tip of the week:**
Put down your work, go talk to someone. It would be hard at first if you are introvert, but don't give up because it is highly impossible that a recruiter will remember you because of one (slightly) lame conversation, and even if they do, there may be some other recruiters coming next time to the career event. Save your coding challenge or mock interview questions to the night, talk to recruiters during the day.
