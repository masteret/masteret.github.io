1. What did I do this past week?  
Project Life is on. It requires a throughout understanding of class material which I know almost nothing about. I paid attention in class but it is so easy to let the voice flow in from one ear and flow out from another. My brain gave up processing the information long time ago and now I have to face the consequence. Spending a day trying to understand how the class example works and apply it to the project. Luckily I am able to get the project to work (looks like it's working now) and on the track to finish this earlier.    

2. What's in my way?  
I definitely need more unittests...The TA takes 2 points off my last project because I don't have enough unittests. It is definitely a painful process to write unittest. In real life, programmers cannot completely rely on QA to test their code, so it is pretty common for the programmers to write their own tests. Same thing happens in this project, except I don't have a QA and I need to write all the tests with my partners.   

3. What will I do next week?  
After reading the material for this project, I realized how little I know about this class. I probably didn't absorb anything during lectures and it totally freaks me out. I am going to read through the material again to better understand what's going on in class. Test 2 is going to be tough, but I have plenty of time to get ready for it.   

4. Experience in class  
The attendance rate has risen up again, I though many people drop this class but it turns out to be only 4 (according to the rank). The current material (Abstract class, vector) is more complicated than anything before. I still can't understand how to tweak it for our own use, but I am going to figure it out before test.  

Get Ready!

Tip of the week:  
[Message encrytion](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/28030015), [Ransomware](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3054220/security/experts-crack-petya-ransomware-enable-hard-drive-decryption-for-free.html) Security is becoming a bigger concern in modern internet. On the good side, encryption can help user protect their privacy like whatsapp recently add the mandatory end-to-end encryption feature. On the other side, force encryption leads to the existence of ransomware. Gladly someone find a way to crack the encryption of the ransomware, but that just means the encryption mechanism isn't prefect. The same thing can happens to the whatsapp encryption. As a programmer, we are the protector of our clients, so we should better equip ourselves with cryptography knowledge in order to protect others.
