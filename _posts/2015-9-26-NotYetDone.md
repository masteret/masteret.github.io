title: Not Yet Done
---
Project Netflix is finished. Career Fair is finished. But it doesn't mean my job is done here. I am getting used to the way that project needs to be implemented. Pair programming is absolutely a great idea. With a partner sitting next to you, you will 1) implement things faster (no facebooking/9gaging) 2) Know structure clearer because you need to explain to him about what you are doing 3) debug faster because the chance of both of you miss the bug is far lower than you miss your own bug.

I was not comfortable with a partner sitting next to me at first. But eventually my mind was submerged into the code (or, in zone) and I didn't even notice about it. Every time we finished a feature and tested it correctness. We high-five and took a rest, talked about school/class. I realized that time passed very fast and the "hangover" after you work in zone is satisfying.

The project Netflix isn't as hard as I thought. With the provided resource and some clarification on Piazza, we managed to submit everything a night before due day, which is an excellent achievement because 1) I haven't submitted anything one day before due day for a long time... 2) We can both work on our own stuff on Thursday. I was also able to help others on Thursday when everyone was rushing to finish the project. Helping others, one of the best feeling in the world. (like beer and sausage/wine and cheese or nuts etc.)

**Tip of the week:**
So, personal projects and internship experience get you an interview, that's good. But what get you a job is your ability to solve problem. Practice on **LeetCode**/**Hackerrank** and read the book **Cracking the Coding Interview**. To be honest, it won't help you if you just scan through them 2 days before the interview, but it will definitely help you in the long run. A coding challenge a day brings you Google offer someday.
