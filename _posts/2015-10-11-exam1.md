title: I can't even...

It's exam week! I am completely shocked by the CS373 exam, although it is just a normal handwritten code exam, like CS312 and 314, it still caught me off guard.

I haven't had this kind of exam in about 2 years, ever since I started to take upper division CS course, most of the exams are code-review based or short answer based. I prepared for CS373 exam exact the same way, and boom! When I received the exam, I felt like I am a warrior facing an legendary monster which I met long time ago, nightmare!

But...I won't be so easily defeated. With my Python skill, I managed to finish most of the questions without any doubt. Let's put aside correctness first, the feeling of victory after finished the exam is so satisfying.

One thing I like the most about this course is that, every single bit of class content will help you, sooner or later. The exam helped me to strengthen my memory about some Python methods. The assignment provided me a very good topic to talk with recruiters, I can proudly talk about what I have done in this course and how I nailed the project. I even came across a job posting that required the exact same skill set as we use in this course!

**Tip of the week:**
I don't know if I have mentioned this before or not, but read the book Cracking the Coding Interview! Even if you only finish 20% of the book by the time you do the interview, it still increase 20% chance of acing a technical interview!
