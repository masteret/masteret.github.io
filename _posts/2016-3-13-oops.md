1. What did I do this past week?  
The week before spring break is not so exciting, but we had a nice guest speaker came to speak to us on Wednesday. It is my 3rd time listened to speak from Rackspace employee, Everett focused on "how to be a good software engineer" and I learned a lot from it.  

2. What's in my way?  
I have several projects going to due the week after spring break and I merely just started to work on it. Allocator seems to be something similar to project in CS439 and I didn't do well in that class, so I definitely need to work on it harder this time.  

3. What will I do next week?  
Work - Project - Study - Catch up learning material. It is good to take a break during the middle of semester but somehow I feel like I have made this an even busier week. Hopefully I can tackle all the problem within this week and next week will be peaceful.    

4. Experience in class  
Just got the result of the test back. I know I didn't do well on test so I am not surprise by the score. But it did surprise me that the grading criteria isn't correct and all score needs to be adjusted, the most surprising part is the average score dropped 10 points after the adjustment.

Tip of the week:  
[AlphaGo](https://gogameguru.com/alphago-shows-true-strength-3rd-victory-lee-sedol/) The tech world seems to be crazy about the Go match between Google's AI AlphaGo and world champion Lee Sedol 9P. It is surprised to know that Artificial intelligence has grown so much. It is my first time to know that an AI can have 2 different neural network to help solving problem and make prediction. After this match catches the world attention, there will definitely be more resource and interest in building AI.
