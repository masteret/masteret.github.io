Quick summary  
1. What did I do this past week?  
Went to class and feel that I am old in CS371p class.  
2. What's in my way?  
Not knowing C++ limits my opportunities in career fair.  
3. What will I do next week?  
Start picking up C++.  
  
  After many rejections from recruiters in Career Fair, I decided to learn C++ in my last semester (hopefully) here. I took Downing's CS373 before and I know that I'd learn a lot from his class, hence I am here in CS371p.  
  
  First week of the class isn't so challenging, I have a feeling that I am still in CS373 class but learning it in a foreign language (C++). Surprisingly, when I talked to my neighbors next to me in class, I found out that they are both sophomore. When I was in CS373, all my neighbors and teammates are graduating seniors. I am the last one in my team that is still in UT. Maybe it is normal to take CS371p prior to CS373? Maybe I just like to take things in a reverse way.  
  
  After attending career fair for many times, I finally realized that without knowing C++, I blocked out almost half of the opportunities. It is so common and useful yet I failed to learn it during my sophomore/junior year. But I still have one semester to master it and I am going to put 100% effort in it.  
  
  Luckily, the first project - Collatz is almost the same as last semester, so I am familiar with what I need to do. Always start early is the key to success, let's make this happen one more semester!

**Tips of the week:**
Udacity.com (https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) is offering a free deep learning course built by Google. If anyone is interested in Machine learning you may want to check this out. It is an intermediate course but as a UTCS student taking this course I think you will be fine.
