title: Not sure if
---
1. What did I do this past week?  
We had our first test this past Friday, I am not 100% confident about my answer but I manage to finish them all. The test caught me off guard by asking questions that I never thought off, I hope my understanding of the material can help me with it.  

2. What's in my way?  
The 3rd project is posted and it looks similar to the project in CS439, which is a nightmare to me. I didn't do well in that project because I didn't understand the concept very well at that time. Now I am offered a 2nd chance to learn the material and I am going to grab the opportunity. Starting earlier and find a partner!  

3. What will I do next week?  
I will need to go through the material for allocator again, I also need a partner for this project. The week after will be Spring break (thanks god finally...) and I am not planning to work during that week, which means I better finish everything within this week or I will probably suffer after Spring break.    

4. Experience in class  
Even though some questions on the test surprised me, the other questions are within my expectation and I was thinking "Oh, nice to see you again" when I saw those questions. I am confident that figuring out problems on the test can help me improve my skills in the long run (both conceptual and skill)

Tip of the week:  
[Problem](https://www.facebook.com/groups/155607091223285/permalink/947688795348440/),  [One of many solutions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477486/python-decimal-range-step-value). I happened to encounter a similar problem like the one in CS group and I am surprised to know that there is no naive solution in Python (without 3rd party library). If I didn't do research in advance, I may be pulling my hair out right now instead of writing this blog, so I will give out this advice to you, if you want to use floating point number in Python, make sure it doesn't get funky in increment or other operations.
