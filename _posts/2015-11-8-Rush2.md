title: Adrenaline Rush 2

Oops, we did it again. We survived project 2 by submitting it in the last minute. At this point of the semester, I feel like I have learned a great deal and can be proud of my achievement in this class. Project 2 is about getting the full site up and running, from building the backend database to the frontend webpage. We work together as a team and achieve this goal.

My job in this phase is to collect data and setup the backend server. Since I have written a script to collect data in phase 1, I can finish this part easily. But setting up a server is far more difficult than I thought. We use Flask and SQLAlchemy as our backend server elements. Even though I have used Bottle, which is a framework similar to Flask, I never actually build it from scratch. It is not easy at all! Most tutorial online will get you something that works in their case, but you won't learn how to modify it to meet your requirement. Most importantly, you don't know how it works behind the scene! That's exactly what you need to know!

After hours of testing and Googling (thanks to my teammates), we manage to get most of the things to work 1 hour before due day. But we still have a big problem to solve, our testcases use our actual database for testing and after each test run, it tears down the database. None of the tutorial tells us how to build two database based on the same model, but thanks to Google, I get it to works 20 minutes before due by adding one line of code. It turns out that you need to initiate Flask if you want to use a specified database after created a SQLAlchemy object.

**Tip of the week:**
Companies like their candidates come with different ~~flavor~~ experience, so spend your time wisely to learn new things. Get our of your comfort zone, I came across [this article](https://medium.com/@maebert/9-things-i-learned-as-a-software-engineer-c2c9f76c9266) a few days ago, it brings up an interesting angle to look at how to prepare yourself in the Software development field.
